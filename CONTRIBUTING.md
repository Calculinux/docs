## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise** - Use simple language
- **Active voice** - "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- **Present tense** - "The system boots" not "The system will boot"
- **Second person** - "You can configure" not "One can configure"
- **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout

### Formatting

- Use **Markdown** for all documentation
- One sentence per line (makes diffs clearer)
- Use code blocks with language specification:
  ```bash
  # Like this
  command --option
  ```
- Use admonitions for important information:
  ```markdown
  !!! tip
      Helpful hint here
  
  !!! warning
      Important warning
  
  !!! danger
      Critical information
  ```

### Structure

- Start with overview/introduction
- Use hierarchical headings (##, ###, ####)
- Include "Next Steps" or "See Also" at end
- Link to related pages
- Use tables for structured data
- Use lists for steps or options

### Code Examples

- **Test all commands** - Verify they work
- **Include output** where helpful
- **Explain non-obvious steps**
- **Use realistic examples**
- **Keep examples simple** but useful

### Images

- Store in `docs/assets/` or `docs/images/`
- Use descriptive filenames: `luckfox-connection.jpg`
- Optimize file size (compress)
- Include alt text: `![Description](path/to/image.jpg)`
- Reference in text: "See Figure 1 below"
