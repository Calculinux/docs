# Building Calculinux

This guide covers building the Calculinux distribution from source.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Host OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar recommended)
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 50GB free space (100GB+ recommended)
- **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum (16GB+ recommended for parallel builds)
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (builds can take 2-6 hours depending on
  hardware)

### Required Software

Install the required packages on your build host:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo \
    gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 \
    python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils \
    iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa \
    libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev \
    zstd liblz4-tool
```

## Build System Overview

Calculinux uses the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) build system
with:

- **Build Tool**: [KAS](https://kas.readthedocs.io/) for simplified
  configuration
- **Base**: Yocto Scarthgap (4.2)
- **Distribution**: Calculinux (based on Poky)
- **Layers**: Multiple meta-layers for hardware support and software packages

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
mkdir calculinux-build && cd calculinux-build
git clone https://github.com/Calculinux/meta-calculinux.git
cd meta-calculinux
```

### 2. Build with KAS

The simplest way to build is using the KAS container:

```bash
./kas-container --ssh-dir ~/.ssh build --update kas-luckfox-lyra-bundle.yaml
```

This command will:

1. Download all required Yocto layers
2. Configure the build for Luckfox Lyra
3. Build the complete distribution image
4. Generate IPK packages

### 3. Locate Build Output

After the build completes (2-6 hours), find your images in:

```bash
build/tmp/deploy/images/luckfox-lyra/
```

Key outputs:

- `calculinux-image-luckfox-lyra.rootfs.wic.gz` - Full disk image for initial
  installation
- `calculinux-bundle-luckfox-lyra.raucb` - RAUC update bundle for updating
  existing installations

## Build Types and Package Feed Configuration

Calculinux images are **automatically configured** with the appropriate package
feed based on how they are built. **Feeds are pre-configured in the image and
typically do not require manual intervention.** This section is primarily
informational to help you understand the feed structure.

### Understanding Feed Configuration

Package feeds are organized by:

1. **DISTRO_CODENAME** - The Yocto/Poky codename (e.g., `walnascar` for
   Scarthgap 4.2)
2. **FEED_SUBFOLDER** - Either `continuous` (development) or `release` (stable
   tags)

The feed URL structure is:

```
https://opkg.calculinux.org/ipk/{DISTRO_CODENAME}/{FEED_SUBFOLDER}/
```

### CI Build Configuration (Automated)

When building via GitHub Actions CI, the build system automatically generates
`build/conf/auto.conf` to configure the package feeds:

| Build Trigger                        | DISTRO_CODENAME | FEED_SUBFOLDER | Resulting Feed URL                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main` branch push                   | `walnascar`     | `continuous`   | `https://opkg.calculinux.org/ipk/walnascar/continuous/` |
| `develop` branch push                | `develop`       | `continuous`   | `https://opkg.calculinux.org/ipk/develop/continuous/`   |
| Tagged release (e.g., `v1.0.0`)      | `walnascar`     | `release`      | `https://opkg.calculinux.org/ipk/walnascar/release/`    |
| Pre-release tag (e.g., `v1.0.0-rc1`) | `walnascar`     | `release`      | `https://opkg.calculinux.org/ipk/walnascar/release/`    |

**Example auto.conf generated by CI:**

```bash
# For main branch:
DISTRO_CODENAME = "walnascar"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "continuous"

# For develop branch:
DISTRO_CODENAME = "develop"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "continuous"

# For tagged release (v1.0.0):
DISTRO_CODENAME = "walnascar"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "release"
```

### Manual Build Configuration

When you build manually (without CI), **auto.conf is not created**, so the
configuration comes from the distribution defaults in
`meta-calculinux-distro/conf/distro/calculinux-distro.conf`:

```bash
# Default values from calculinux-distro.conf:
DISTRO_CODENAME = "walnascar"           # Inherited from poky.conf
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER ??= "continuous"  # Defaults to continuous
```

**Manual Build Behavior:**

| What You Do                                                            | DISTRO_CODENAME         | FEED_SUBFOLDER         | Feed URL                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `kas-container build kas-luckfox-lyra-bundle.yaml`                     | `walnascar` (from Poky) | `continuous` (default) | `ipk/walnascar/continuous/` |
| Add `CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "release"` to `build/conf/local.conf` | `walnascar` (from Poky) | `release` (override)   | `ipk/walnascar/release/`    |
| Add `DISTRO_CODENAME = "develop"` to `build/conf/local.conf`           | `develop` (override)    | `continuous` (default) | `ipk/develop/continuous/`   |

### Feed Configuration Variables

These variables control which package feed your image will use:

- **`DISTRO_CODENAME`**: Distribution codename
  - Inherited from `poky.conf` (currently `walnascar` for Scarthgap 4.2)
  - CI overrides this to `develop` for develop branch builds
  - Can be manually overridden in `build/conf/local.conf` or
    `build/conf/auto.conf`

- **`CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER`**: Feed subdirectory
  - Defaults to `continuous` if not specified
  - CI sets to `release` for tagged builds
  - Can be manually overridden in `build/conf/local.conf`

### When to Change Feed Configuration

You typically **don't need to change feed configuration** unless:

1. **Testing a different feed**: You want to test your local build with a
   different package repository
2. **Custom deployment**: You're creating a custom image variant with specific
   package sources
3. **Development workflow**: You're developing packages and want to use a test
   feed

To change the feed configuration for manual builds, create or edit
`build/conf/local.conf`:

```bash
# Example: Use the release feed instead of continuous
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "release"

# Example: Use the develop feed
DISTRO_CODENAME = "develop"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "continuous"
```

### Verifying Feed Configuration

To check which feed your image will use:

```bash
# Inside kas-container shell:
./kas-container shell kas-luckfox-lyra-bundle.yaml

# Query the feed configuration:
bitbake -e calculinux-image | grep -E "^(DISTRO_CODENAME|CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER|PACKAGE_FEED_BASE_PATHS)="
```

Example output:

```
DISTRO_CODENAME="walnascar"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER="continuous"
PACKAGE_FEED_BASE_PATHS="ipk/walnascar/continuous"
```

### How Feed Configuration Works

The feed configuration is baked into the image during build:

1. **Build Time**: Yocto reads `DISTRO_CODENAME` and `CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER`
   variables
2. **Image Creation**: Feed URL is written to `/etc/opkg/opkg.conf` in the image
3. **Runtime**: `opkg` uses the configured feed URL to install/update packages

Users can still manually change feeds after installation by editing
`/etc/opkg/opkg.conf`, but this is only needed for advanced use cases (see
[Package Management](../user-guide/package-management.md) for details).

## Configuring Your Build

### Setting Distribution Codename

To manually set the distribution codename, edit `conf/local.conf`:

```bash
# For stable builds
DISTRO_CODENAME = "walnascar"

# For development builds
DISTRO_CODENAME = "develop"
```

### Setting Feed Subfolder

To configure the package feed subfolder, edit `conf/local.conf`:

```bash
# For continuous/rolling releases
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "continuous"

# For stable releases
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "release"
```

### Complete Build Configuration Example

For a development build:

```bash
# conf/local.conf
DISTRO_CODENAME = "develop"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "continuous"
```

For a release build:

```bash
# conf/local.conf
DISTRO_CODENAME = "walnascar"
CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER = "release"
```

## Build Targets

Calculinux provides several build targets:

### Main Image

```bash
bitbake calculinux-image
```

The primary Calculinux image with desktop environment and applications.

### Minimal Image

```bash
bitbake calculinux-image-minimal
```

A minimal base system without desktop environment.

### SDK

```bash
bitbake calculinux-image -c populate_sdk
```

Generates a cross-compilation SDK for application development.

## Build Options

### Clean Build

To perform a clean build:

```bash
# Clean everything
bitbake -c cleanall calculinux-image

# Clean specific package
bitbake -c cleanall <package-name>
```

### Parallel Builds

Configure parallel builds in `conf/local.conf`:

```bash
# Number of parallel BitBake tasks
BB_NUMBER_THREADS ?= "8"

# Number of parallel make tasks
PARALLEL_MAKE ?= "-j 8"
```

Adjust numbers based on your CPU cores and available RAM.

### Disk Space Management

Monitor disk usage:

```bash
# Check build directory size
du -sh build/tmp

# Clean shared state cache
rm -rf build/sstate-cache/*

# Clean downloads (only if needed)
rm -rf build/downloads/*
```

## Build Output

After a successful build, find images in:

```
build/tmp/deploy/images/luckfox-lyra/
```

Key files:

- `calculinux-image-*.wic.gz` - Flashable SD card image
- `calculinux-image-*.tar.gz` - Root filesystem archive
- `calculinux-image-*.manifest` - List of installed packages

## Flashing the Image

### To SD Card (Linux)

```bash
# Decompress the image
gunzip calculinux-image-*.wic.gz

# Flash to SD card (replace /dev/sdX with your card)
sudo dd if=calculinux-image-*.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sudo sync
```

### To SD Card (Cross-platform)

Use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or
[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) with the `.wic.gz`
file.

## CI/CD Integration

Calculinux uses GitHub Actions for automated builds. The CI system
automatically:

1. Detects the branch or tag being built
2. Sets appropriate `DISTRO_CODENAME` and `CALCULINUX_FEED_SUBFOLDER`
3. Builds the image
4. Publishes packages to the correct feed location
5. Uploads build artifacts

### CI Configuration Files

The build behavior is controlled by:

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Main CI workflow
- `conf/auto.conf` - Auto-generated build configuration
- `conf/calculinux.conf` - Distribution configuration

## Package Feed Publishing

After building, packages can be published to the opkg feed:

```bash
# Upload to continuous feed (development)
rsync -avz tmp/deploy/ipk/ \
  user@opkg.calculinux.org:/var/www/opkg/ipk/walnascar/continuous/

# Upload to release feed (stable)
rsync -avz tmp/deploy/ipk/ \
  user@opkg.calculinux.org:/var/www/opkg/ipk/walnascar/release/
```

The CI system handles this automatically for official builds.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If a build fails:

1. Check the error message in the build log
2. Clean the failing package: `bitbake -c cleanall <package>`
3. Retry the build
4. Check [Common Issues](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md)

### Disk Space Issues

If you run out of disk space:

```bash
# Remove old build artifacts
bitbake -c clean calculinux-image

# Clear shared state cache
rm -rf build/sstate-cache/*
```

### Network Issues

If downloads fail:

```bash
# Use mirrors
# Add to conf/local.conf:
PREMIRRORS_prepend = "\
  git://.*/.* http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/mirror/sources/ \n \
  ftp://.*/.* http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/mirror/sources/ \n \
  http://.*/.* http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/mirror/sources/ \n \
  https://.*/.* http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/mirror/sources/ \n"
```
