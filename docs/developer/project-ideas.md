# Project Ideas

While we have limited RAM and CPU resources, there's a surprising account you can do with 128 MB of RAM. Terminal based productivity apps have been around since the dawn of computing. For anything you decide to work on, you could choose to port something that exists, customizing and creating a package, or you could create an entirely new application to take full advantage of the Picocalc's unique capabilities!
