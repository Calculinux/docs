!!! info "PWM Audio Details"
    The PicoCalc has built-in audio support using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on GPIO pins. However, there are significant limitations:
    
    - The Lyra's PWM is not available on the correct pins without hardware modification
    - Software PWM must be used instead on pins with only 1.2V tolerance
    - This results in **low volume** audio and **high CPU usage**
    
    For proper audio, hardware modifications are needed to access the correct PWM pins or use the I2S interface. See the [Hardware Modifications guide](modifications.md) for details on enabling full-volume audio (documentation stub - refer to the [ClockworkPi forum](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/) for community solutions).

!!! note "Custom Hardware Projects"
    These expansion options enable custom hardware projects and modifications for advanced users comfortable with electronics work.
