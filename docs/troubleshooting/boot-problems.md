### SPI NAND Interference

Some Luckfox Lyra boards include SPI NAND flash memory. The RK3506G2 boot ROM **always tries NAND first**, so if your board has NAND with any firmware on it, the boot ROM will ignore your SD card completely.

**Quick Check:**
- Lyra models with "SPI NAND" or "Lyra B" or "Lyra Plus" have NAND
- Check your purchase specifications
- If unsure, try booting - if SD card is ignored, you likely have NAND

**Solution:**
You must erase the SPI NAND flash. See the comprehensive **[SPI NAND Erase Guide](erase-nand.md)** for detailed step-by-step instructions covering:

- Windows method (RKDevTool)
- Linux method (upgrade_tool)
- MaskRom mode recovery
- Troubleshooting failed erases

!!! danger "Critical: Data Loss"
    Erasing SPI NAND will **permanently delete all data** on the NAND flash. This cannot be undone. Ensure you understand the implications before proceeding.
