# Basic Usage

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This page is currently being developed. Check back soon for comprehensive usage instructions.

## Getting Started

For now, please refer to:

- [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.md) - Essential commands and tips
- [First Boot](../getting-started/first-boot.md) - Initial setup and configuration
- [Package Management](package-management.md) - Installing and managing software

## Daily usage patterns
Normally, for some daily usage patterns, you would need the following types of packages/apps:
- A text/code editor
- A file manager (not neccesarry, could be done through the command line)
- Any other tools or apps you use (like networking tools)

We recommend vim as a text editor to use with calculinux, as it has extensive documentation, useful feature, and is very lightweight.

As for the file management system, you could just use the command line, but it's sometimes more useful to display your files "graphically" so we reccomend you use Midnight Commander (mc) which displays your files in a TUI-style way, to make it easier to do file management.

## Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Command line basics
- File management
- System monitoring
- Common tasks
